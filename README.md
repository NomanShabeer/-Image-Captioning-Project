# Image Captioning with Deep Learning

This GitHub repository hosts a project on Image Captioning using Deep Learning. It combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to generate descriptive captions for images. The project is based on TensorFlow and Keras and includes various components:

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: The code loads and preprocesses image and caption data from the Flickr30k dataset, including text cleaning and tokenization.
- **Pretrained Model**: It uses a pretrained VGG16 model for image feature extraction, which can be replaced with other architectures for experimentation.
- **Caption Generation**: The model generates captions for images and can be fine-tuned or customized as needed.
- **Evaluation**: The project includes evaluation metrics like BLEU score to assess the quality of generated captions.
- **Visualization**: It offers visualization tools to see both good and bad caption examples.

## Getting Started
1. **Data Setup**: Download the Flickr8k dataset or provide your own image and caption data. Update the data directory paths in the code.

2. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed, including TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, and Matplotlib.
3. **Model Training**: Train the image captioning model using the provided code. You can adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters as needed.
4. **Inference**: Use the trained model to generate captions for new images.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize the results, including both good and bad captions.

## Results
The project provides sample results, including images with generated captions, along with their BLEU scores. This helps in assessing the performance of the model.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you want to enhance the model, improve data preprocessing, or add new features, feel free to submit pull requests.
